      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m River Magee! I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and I am currently a junior at Allegheny College majoring Integrative Informatics with a minor in Theatre. In my free time, I enjoying spending time with my friends, playing video games, and watching movies. I am a hardcore Brooklyn Nets fan (as I should be), so I am always down for a conversation about basketball. My favorite foods include bacon and eggs on a roll, any form of ramen, and steak cooked rare.</description>

      <description>I have a few areas of interest that I hope to explore in throughout this class. I will go on to describe them below, and list potential research ideas for each that I would find fulfilling.
Artificial Intelligence Since playing my first video game, I have been interested in artificial intelligence. It has always astonished me the ways in which AI can mimic human mannerisms, and react to special circumstances in dynamic and organic ways.</description>
