      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m River Magee! I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and I am currently a junior at Allegheny College majoring Integrative Informatics with a minor in Theatre. In my free time, I enjoying spending time with my friends, playing video games, and watching movies. I am a hardcore Brooklyn Nets fan (as I should be), so I am always down for a conversation about basketball. My favorite foods include bacon and eggs on a roll, any form of ramen, and steak cooked rare.</description>
